       "   u\"We had signed up weeks ago for the event because we really wanted to make sure we could be a part of it. With that in mind, we had been looking forward to partaking in this for a long time! It was nice when the time finally came to help out. We headed out very early on Thanksgiving morning (around 5am) to make it to the church by around 6:15am for the 6:30am shift. By the way, don't park at the Hilton parking garage! We had to pay $47 because we didn't do our research and look up the other much less expensive options in the area- whoops!\",\n",
       "   u'Anyway, when we arrived, the church was already hustling to prepare for the day and the vibes were super positive and uplifting. We were greeted by almost everybody that we ran into including other volunteers and people waiting outside for their meals. It was a very beautiful feeling, and we just felt right at home. ',\n",
       "   u'We were directed to head upstairs where we checked in with the staff and were given hair nets, gloves, and aprons. We waited until it was time to get to work, and then headed into the dining room to get started. We were so excited, and everybody was really looking forward to pitching in and being part of such an optimistic team this holiday.',\n",
       "   u'The first thing I noticed was that the dining hall was very COLD. The windows were open, and it was a brittle morning, so that cool air did not feel good to me personally. Though the service was so helpful and generous, I immediately regretted checking in my coat and hat with the Glide staff. I resisted going back to get them because I had my mind set on the task at hand, and that was to help others. I just stuck it out and tried not to think about being cold. There are worse things.',\n",
       "   u'The gentleman in charge showed everybody to their job, and everybody was happy to be assigned wherever he needed them. He explained the tasks, and people caught on quickly. It was really interesting how the entire process just flowed organically and was very effective right off the bat. There were no issues! Not that I saw at least. Everybody just got to work and made this special day happen!',\n",
       "   u'I was in charge of folding plastic utensils into a napkin. I think I prepared a couple hundred of them! It was awesome. From there, my husband took the utensils and put them into cups. Then, another young lady took the cups and handed them to the guest before they headed over to receive their meals. It was an organized chain of events, and EVERY person played a vital role.',\n",
       "   u'I loved getting to greet the guests and wish them a happy holiday. Some people even thanked us for volunteering which was really really sweet and thoughtful. I spent a lot of time observing others, and saw a lot of gratitude happening. People were grateful for the meals they received, they were happy to see the volunteers, happy to see the Glide staff, happy to be inside and safe, and just happy to be alive. It was unlike anything I had seen in a long time. It taught me a lot about the importance of perspective. I could have spent the morning complaining about being cold and missing my jacket, but it was the guests that morning that truly taught me an unforgettable Thanksgiving lesson... just keep in mind the little things. Those little things are... everything. I could instead focus on my good health, my legs that held me up, my eyes that help me see the beauty of the world and the beautiful smiling faces, my brain that allows me to function and enjoy life, my heart that helps me to see and feel compassion for others... and so on and so on..',\n",

       "   u'Thank you sooooo much Glide staff and volunteers! Every single thing you do; from a little smile to serving a meal, to offering a helping hand, makes a difference. You enrich lives not only around you, but your own life as well. You become a better person when you spend your time in the service of others. In this world that struggles with suffering and pain, you are creating a ripple that transforms fear and pain into loving kindness. With enough time and patience, we can change the world!',\n",

       "   u'I\\'m standing in line outside on a beautiful sunny afternoon enjoying the peace and quite. Nobody is even talking to anybody. All of a sudden the creepy psychotic lunatic in a yellow jacket starts yelling at everybody for smoking in line. I told him nobody is smoking. He said \"I saw a puff of smoke!\". There was nothing. Then he gives me a lecture about how if \"it doesn\\'t apply then I shouldn\\'t reply\" as if I were an errant schoolboy and I needed to be taught some manners. How dare I point out the fact that nobody is smoking and he might need a serious psychological examination. I\\'m all in favor of giving disadvantaged people with mental problems jobs in the community. But they still should have to meet quality standards and have proper training and supervision. Glide hires street thugs for security staff and then kicks back and let\\'s them abuse the hell out of people. How careless and irresponsible can you get?',\n",
       "   u'After receiving a thorough lecture on manners for audaciously correcting Glide\\'s security staff over an imaginary puff of smoke, I finally got downstairs. A young girl hands me a tray with a big smile on her face. \"Welcome to Glide!\" she says. So adorable. I sit down to enjoy my filet-o-fish. If you\\'ve ever had it at McDonald\\'s or had Van de Kamp\\'s or maybe Mrs. Paul\\'s or perhaps you trust the Gorton\\'s Fisherman, everybody knows filet-o-fish is golden brown on the outside and white on the inside. NOT Glide. This fish was black. And they weren\\'t serving blacked Cajun style fish. This was a McDonald\\'s style filet-o-fish that was served to me and it was charred black. I opened it up. It was dark grey on the inside. I\\'m no food expert but I do believe Glide is serving spoiled rotten fish to homeless people. Think about how many hands this had to have passed through before it even got to me. Somebody took this charred piece of fish out of the oven and put it in a stainless steel container. Then someone else took it out of the stainless steel container and laid it on the bun on the tray while some else put a slice of onion and lettuce on it. And so on and so forth...until the adorable child hands it to me with a big smile on her face.',\n",
       "   u\"I'm supposed to eat this and be grateful because I got it for free and have no right to complain. Meanwhile Glide is harassing the hell out of homeless people and serving spoiled rotten food to them while collecting millions of dollars from tax payers and other private donors. Are they accountable to anyone? \",\n",
       "   u'After I pass on the fish, a friend sitting across from me starts having a seizure. Glide staff immediately lays her on the floor. A lady suggests that they put something in her mouth to prevent her from swallowing her tongue. Glide staff correctly tells the woman that they know what they are doing. I don\\'t have any problem with this. I turned to another bystander who was standing next to me and simply asked \"do they have a nurse on staff?\". Glide staff started screaming at me. \"We know what we\\'re doing!!!!\" they shout. To which I replied \"I don\\'t see why it\\'s necessary for you to for you to scream?\". That only made them scream even louder. meanwhile my friend is still having a seizure on the floor. Another security monitor came over to me and asked me to leave. I ignored him and kept kept eating. He continued to ask \\xa0me to move to another table. I kept ignoring him til eventually he went away. Paramedics finally arrived and the situation was resolved. What a bunch of angry psychotic lunatics Glide hires to keep homeless people in line. Total disservice to The City of San Francisco.'],\n",

       "   u'\"I like Glide. I like it here better, though. Here, you can be yourself.\"',\n",
       "   u\"This may seem odd, given what I said before, but there were things that over time began me on the road to leaving. One was that the experience I had with strangers one day was not the same I had consistently. Because it's a tourist destination.... heck, first stop on the Tales of the City tour.... the majority of people any given Sunday morning are not members. This means that any reaction you may get outside..... purse clutched, children pulled away and 'shielded' from you, people making excuses to get the hell away from you and sit somewhere else, people turning their back and refusing any contact with you..... these things may well happen to you there. Indeed, it absolutely will if you continue to go week after week and are visibly 'other'.\",\n",
       "   u'It also bears mentioning that while we are welcome there, and transfolk are most certainly a significant part of Glide at the lay level, when it comes to the pastoral level there\\'s not really much understanding. No animosity, don\\'t get me wrong, but when it comes to cultural competence with transgender specific issues.... well. They tend to see trans as an exotic flavor of gay, rather than understanding that we intersect with any sexual orientation, and when you refer only to people being welcome whomever we love or whatever our sexual orientation, you are not using trans inclusive language. Indeed, when you one offers welcome based on sexual orientation and not gender identity, you are not putting out the welcome mat for transgender people. It may seem a minor point, but many of us have been rejected at every turn, even from those we thought accepting and omitting a statement that falls JUST short of \"transgender\" makes a statement I\\'m not sure they know they\\'re making. \\xa0There\\'s no hatred of us from the pastors by any stretch of the imagination. They\\'re all lovely individuals. It\\'s simply that trans issues seems to be outside their area of focus. Indeed, when they list the people who they specifically welcome at the beginning of a service, they mention addicts, homeless .... and, yes, gays.... this is their focus. There\\'s only one person who will mention transgender people at all, and he\\'s an intern. So, if talk of and specific mention of transgender and our unique political, cultural, and spiritual needs is important to you, this may not be your place. There are a thousand reasons this may be the church for you, but if trans specificity something you need, you won\\'t get it here. You will be welcome, and that\\'s not nothing. But your transness won\\'t be discussed from the pulpit.',\n",
       "   u\"And honestly, the last thing that's leading me away is that the church is pretty much a fundraiser for the Glide Foundation. It's a sales pitch. And if you're too resourced to be a client, but not resourced enough to give much (or not a fit for available volunteer time due to disability)... again, you're welcome, but you may end up feeling like you're outside the model in some significant way.\",\n",

       "  [u'I have been a patient at several dental offices in the area, and Arlington Center for Dentistry has a few customer service issues that need to be addressed.',\n",
       "   u\"Communication among the front desk staff is not up-to-par with others in the area. One of the staff members (Dayana) was very rude in tone and was not able to direct me to the manager (and even not knowing their manager's schedule--how do you not know when your supervisor comes into the office) after I had an issue with a procedure, forcing me to have to reschedule. She was more concerned with informing me of the cancellation fee that I had to pay instead of getting my questions/concerns answered. But, my other interactions with the other staff members has been reasonable (they were pretty friendly).\",\n",
       "   u'As far as my procedures completed, the medical professionals were very friendly, efficient and knowledgeable.',\n",
       "   u\"With an expansive, well-designed office, it's too bad that the customer service leaves a bit to be desired.\"],\n",
       "  [u\"I chose Arlington Center for Dentistry because of convenience. Located right in Clarendon and they have Saturday hours meaning I don't have to take time off work for visits. I received treatment of Invisalign and while I am not sure if it's Invisalign itself to blame or this particular office and orthodontist but I am very dissatisfied. \",\n",
       "   u'1. Making appointments is very easy. I was always able to get a Saturday appointment. Note that the orthodontics department is only open on Mondays and Saturdays. So basically you have a 50% chance of a Saturday appointment.',\n",
       "   u'2. Billing: I received a treatment plan of what my insurance would pay and what I would pay and the numbers added up until the very end where I was charged a little extra more because the \"insurance didn\\'t pay and you can\\'t predict this so it\\'s you have to pay out of pocket.\" Since it was less than $100 I let it go but be cautious and I would also talk to the insurance company directly so you aren\\'t screwed over in the end. They (ACFD) was suppose to start billing me monthly per payment plan but they never did and I received a phone call months later saying it was my fault. No, it\\'s not. I signed the payment plan and agreed on this arrangement you just failed to bill me properly. So I made a large sum payment which they didn\\'t make note on my account so I was a couple thousand dollars short on my account. Since I pay very close attention to payments I personally had to go to the lady in charge of billing to sort this out. She\\'s very kind and thanked me for coming in on my own but really they should be on top of this. ',\n",
       "   u\"3. Some of the routine office visits went smoothly. Some I had to wait in the chair forever while I saw the one main orthodontist go from patient to patient. It all seems very rushed and unprofessional. My orthodontist didn't really seem to care about my specific treatment and it was all very by the book. Everything they said was vague. I had specific issues with my teeth and they sort of dismissed it. \",\n",
       "   u\"4. Invisalign: My treatment including refinements lasted 16 months. Luckily I researched Invisalign and read since refinements only slightly move teeth I could switch trays once a week rather than two weeks so I was able to talk them into doing that. I didn't have any problems with changing trays once a week but had to stress that every time I went in for a checkup because they kept thinking I was changing them every two weeks. You do what works best for you. Once my treatment was done they said they would contour my teeth and polish them (removed the buttons and shape the teeth). Some of the tops of my teeth were naturally uneven and jagged. But when it came time to do all of that they didn't (contour) so I had to mention it so they hastily did so. Some dentist charge a lot for this but it's basically very simple and they just file the teeth down a bit. My orthodontist did this but did it very poorly. My teeth ended up uneven and she filed down one tooth way too much. I could clearly see in the mirror that it was uneven but she kept saying it looks good. She offered to make any additional adjustments on my next visit if it continued to bother me but with her unsteady hand I'm just going to deal with it. Overall I would say my teeth look 70% better than what they did before. But for the cost of the entire treatment and the whole process it was not worth it. If you really want to go through the Invisalign treatment I would choose an elite Invisalign specific orthodontist who's reputable.\"],\n",

Similar to other reviewers, I had never had a cavity, but was told that a malformed tooth (which hasn't changed for the last \\xa015 years) was in 'critical' condition. The dentist aggressively berated me about how 'risky' it was not to have a crown put on. \",\n",
       "   u'However, since ACD was so convenient for me, I thought i\\'d give the practice one more chance. I had my second appointment yesterday. I was told that I have three cavities forming (not true, based on other dentists\\' reviews) and the dentist asked me whether I had \"grown up in a developed part of the country... with fluoride in the water. I\\'m from New England. So yes, there\\'s fluoride in the water. ',\n",
       "   u\"The worst part of my visit, however, was the fact that the tools laid out for the dental hygenist were visibly dirty -- with a previous patient's plaque on them, and rusted handles. The hygenist moved to begin my cleaning, so I finally interrupted her to ask that clean instruments be used. She hadn't even noticed. The scariest part of the situation is that these tools routinely break the gum skin and draw blood, meaning that used tools are not just unhygenic; they're capable of transmitting bloodborne pathogens between patients if traces of the last person's blood were not cleaned off. \",\n",
       "   u\"Returning to this dentist would be putting my health at risk, and from the other reviews on here it's clear that I would be pressured into unnecessary procedures sooner rather than later. I'll find a new dentist.\"],\n",
       "  [u'Easy to make appointments online, no wait times, and great dentists and hygienists BUT like many others have said, the billing is often wrong (if I ever even see a bill to check it) and the receptionist who answered my call today about an inaccurate bill was rude and unprofessional.

       "  [u'Im giving one star because there was no option for zero stars. So unhappy with these people! I had half my tooth fall out 2 months ago, and have been given the run around on so many occasions- when all i wanted was for this tooth to be fixed. ',\n",

       "   u\"On a side note, every appointment i've had here, i was made to wait for lengthy periods (one time i was sitting in the chair for 45 minutes before someone attended to me- ridiculous! and without even an apology for being made to wait so long).\",\n",

Arlington Center for Dentistry wanted to charge me nearly 2k to take care of all of these alleged cavities and, unlike most dentists, did not need me to schedule another appointment... they recommended that I have the cavities filled right then and there, since it was an \"urgent\" situation. \\xa0',\n",
       "   u'As my regular dentist had never found a problem with my teeth, I was quite skeptical. This was my first experience seeing a dentist without paying via dental insurance, too, so I had to wait for a while to have enough extra cash to see another provider.',\n",
